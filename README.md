Week 21 Challenge

## Description

This purpose of this project was to refactor a given application and convert it to using Apollo server and Graphql for its routing and fetches. This project involved a large amount of navigation and understanding of the necessary steps leading up to modifying the front end UI in order to incorporate these new technologies. This project has been very helpful in allowing me to follow the lines necessary to refactor some amount of code to use Apollo server, and learning what each step of the refactoring process does in regards to the whole project.
